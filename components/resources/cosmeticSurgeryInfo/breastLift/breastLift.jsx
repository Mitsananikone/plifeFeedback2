                Cosmetic Surgery Breast Lift

                <br />
                A cosmetic surgery breast lift, also known as mastopexy, is performed to elevate sagging breasts to a more youthful position. This procedure involves the removal of excess skin and the reshaping of the breast tissue. Breasts that have lost volume over time can be simultaneously augmented using implants. The goal of a breast lift is to give the breasts a firmer, more uplifted appearance.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span className="text-m flex-wrap">
                For many women, the combination of aging, gravity, childbirth, and breastfeeding can cause the breasts to sag and lose their youthful shape. A breast lift can rejuvenate the figure by achieving a more uplifted and firm breast contour.

              <span className="text-m flex-wrap">
                The decision to have a breast lift stems from the desire to restore a youthful and perky breast shape. The procedure can dramatically improve self-confidence and body image by restoring the natural contours of the breasts.

                Ideal candidates for breast lifts are women who have experienced changes in breast shape due to aging, weight fluctuations, childbirth, and breastfeeding.

                The surgery typically takes 2-3 hours and can be done under general or local anesthesia. The technique chosen by the surgeon will depend on the patient&apos;s breast size, degree of sagging, and individual goals. Common incision patterns include:
